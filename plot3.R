## Load the data required for the project 1
## Load only the data that contains dates 2/1/2007 and 2/2/2007
## Total of 2880 obsercations of 9 variables
## Make sure that the project file is unzipped and placed in current working directory
## (This script assumes that the unzipped project file is located at Current Working Directory)

## Combine the Date and Time variables in the data frame and create a new DateTime variable

## Plot 3
## The below code does the following
## opens a PNG graphics device with dimention 480x480 as required by the project
## Creates the required plot and saves the plot to graphics device ( PNG in our case)
## The PNG file will be saved in the current working directory
png(filename="plot3.png",width=480,height=480)
